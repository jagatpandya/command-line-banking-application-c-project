# Command-Line Banking Application
This program was a lab practice and evolved into a simple command-line banking application written in C. It empowers users to create accounts, each assigned a unique account number for new entries. With this application, users can seamlessly perform various banking operations, including adding funds, making withdrawals, and checking account details.

***How to install gcc on ubuntu 18.04...***

**Use a text editor to write a C program** 

Open the C program file `runtheprogram.c` in your preferred text editor, for example, using:
```bash
gedit runtheprogram.c
```
**Check the C program**
```bash
cat runtheprogram.c
```
**Compile the C program**
> **Note:** This command will invoke the GNU Compiler (GCC) to compile the file `runtheprogram.c` and output (-o) the result to an executable named `experiment`.

```bash
gcc runtheprogram.c -o experiment
```
**Run the C Program (Machine Code)**
```bash
./experiment
```
Take a look at the `runtheprogram.c` file below. It's used as a simple example to demonstrate how to run a C program in Linux using GCC.
